## Overview
Dolphonica is a virtual reality demo that was showcased at a digital show and tell event in 2019. As a dolphin, the player travels through a futuristic "space aquatic" environment, navigating past obstacles. The game uses adaptive audio and beat synchronised visuals to create an immersive, auditory-visual experience. 

Dolphonica explores the positive psychological concept of flow - [link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/flow) - a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in their activity, usually at peak performance. Successful level navigation builds up a flow meter which temporarily changes the game aesthetics and rewards the player with invincibility.

## Gameplay

The aim of the game is to guide the dolphin through a sequence of rings. The rings appear as one of two colours: green or blue. The player must switch the dolphin to the correct colour via the Oculus Touch shoulder triggers. The player loses health if they pass through a ring and fail to do so. The player must also avoid the marine animals which obstruct the pathway. The game has an escalating tempo which is divided into 10 levels. The game ends on completion of the final level, or if the player dies.

## Audio
The music and sound effects were created in Ableton.

The score consists of two themes. The main theme is an ambient house style track with an escalating tempo. The flow theme - triggered when the player passes through a target number of rings successfully and becomes invincible - is a stripped down version of the main theme. The SFX, which are beat synchronised, are either percussive elements or electronic sounds that were pitched melodically. 

## Visuals
The gameplay and reactive visuals were created in Unity. The dolphin passes through rings that pulse to the 4/4 time signature of the score.

The concentric rings of circles in the background are beat synchronised musical layers (e.g. the blue circle corresponds to the shaker track of the musical score).
